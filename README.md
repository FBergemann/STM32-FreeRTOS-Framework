# STM32-FreeRTOS-Framework
This is a framework demo for the NUCLEO-F767ZI.<br/>
It's using FreeRTOS to manage a number of independent tasks.<br/>
Currently, those tasks are just about LED blinking (in different ways).<br/>
But there are #2 dedicated task for logging to console and USB-Stick (as central function for a framework).<br/>
When this is done, some "real" tasks will be added for the add-on board X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1 (sensors).<br/>
