# STM32-FreeRTOS-Framework
#
# This is a framework demo for the NUCLEO-F767ZI.
# It's using FreeRTOS to manage a number of independent tasks.
# Currently, those tasks are just about LED blinking (in different ways).
# But there are #2 dedicated task for logging to console and USB-Stick (as central function for a framework).
# When this is done, some "real" tasks will be added for the add-on board X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1 (sensors).
